# Interview Summary and Findings

## Research Findings
### 1. All interviews valued autonomy or flexibility to their art subjects.
- Vince wanted flexibility to the art collecting mechanic in AC.
- Kate enjoyed the flexibility of local theater.
- Emily said her students learned best when given autonomy to explore.
### 2. All interviews embraced small friendly communities.
- Vince enjoyed the use of his AC community in the art collecting mechanic.
- Kate felt best in small local communities or class settings.
- Emily said her students often learned from each other when paired together.
### 3. All interviews showed evidence that the best learning opportunities happen in engaging environments.
- Vince mostly enjoyed how engaging the mechanic was but thought there was a missed opportunity to learn from it.
- Kate originally enjoyed theater because it was en engaging way to learn new things and new roles.
- Emily kept her students engaged by giving them opportunities to play / do things their interested in.



## Summary of Methods
### I selected interviewees through my network of people:
- The first interview was more casual, as I was talking to a friend about animal crossing and realized that he knew more about fine art than anyone I knew so I took that opportunity to learn more from him.
- The second was more intentional, as I was interested in a possible acting/improve game so I reached out to an old friend who went to New York after high school to pursue theater.
- The third was recommended by Lien that I should interview a Child Educator. I did not originally see this solution as being for kids, but I think inclusivity is important so I interviewed a middle school band teacher that I knew in college.

### The Questions came about more casually:
- Most of these conversations were fueled by my own curiosity.
- I did not focus on the current pandemic much because I would want my solution to be workable for both pre and post pandemic.
- I possibly should've asked about that more but it didn't come up as much.
