# Interview: Emily J. (Child Music Educator)
## Context
I did not know who to reach out for my 3rd interview. Then Lien suggested a child educator based on her initial reaction to my ideas. I did not originally see my solution as being for children, but I think the possibility that they could be included is important to me since these games might happen in a family setting. I reached out to a friend from college who majored in music and has since become a middle school band teacher.

## Questions
### Question 1: How do you get kids to engage more?
- She tries to balance the material with some modern or familiar music pieces such as pop songs or movie scores that the kids can recognize and be excited about learning.
- This is especially true for students who are just getting involved in band.

### Question 2: What do you enjoy most as an educator?
- She enjoys seeing students have breakthroughs for a piece their working on 
- Just generally being proud of and having fun with their work.

### Question 3: How do you bring fun to the class room?
- She likes to get the more advanced students involved in music / show planning whenever possible.
- She said they enjoy feeling like they helped produce and seeing the results of their work.
- This also gives them opportunities to push themselves outside of normal class lessons and learn from each other.
