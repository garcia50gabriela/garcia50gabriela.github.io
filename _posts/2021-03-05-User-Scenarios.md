## Story Board
Below is the story board I imagine for a young audience member and their gardian.
- They begin by going to the museum and downloading the app if they haven't already.
- Next they explore the museum until they find a piece they want to add to their gallery. They add it to their gallery through a QR code somewhere in the museum. And repeat this as many times as they want.
- Later on at home they can interact with their new piece and play with others.

## App Design 
These are some images of what I imagine the actual game / app will look like.

The home screen will be the user's gallery, where they can explore the space and the pieces they've collected and displayed.

They can zoom in walls they have set with art pieces. They can also use AR mode to see these pieces in their actual space.

They can also zoom in on specific pieces, or also view them in AR mode.

Each piece will have a detail section with some history on the real piece, notes about when the piece was added to the player's app, and an optional notes section for the player to add to.

The player will be able add authentic pieces or forgeries.

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/app_download.png" height="400"/>

The player will be able add authentic pieces by taking pictures in museums.

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/app_play.png" height="400"/>

The player will be able add forgeries by winning trivia compititions with others.

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/app_shop.png" height="400"/>

The player can buy things to decorate or expand their gallery by selling their forgeries.

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/app_storage.png" height="400"/>

Their will be storage available for furniture items and art pieces that the user either does not want to display or does not have room for.
