## Purpose
A way to familiarize and engage people with key pieces of art after or beyond a museum setting, through casual game play that fits their lifestyle and schedule constraints.

## Audience
These are the poeople who might play or use my game:
- Gamers who enjoy card and collectables games
- Art Educators / parents who want to get their kids interested in art
- People who go to museums a lot
- People who never or seldom go to museums

## Barriers
Difficult or blocking obstacles to implimenting my game:
- Getting museums on board
- Distributing to the correct museums
- Rights to print the art
- Creating game play that doesn’t glorify one piece of art over another
- Creating something worth continuing to build
- Retaining knowledge from gameplay interaction
- Getting people into museums to initially buy the product

## Player Transformations
Transformations that players will go through, especially over time:
### Knowledge
They’re familiar with important art pieces and why they’re important with lasting impressions
### Behavioral
They want to go to museums more to build up their personal collection
### Relationships
They have conversations with their friends about pieces in or not in their collection

## Partners
People who could help develop my game:
- Collectable Expert
- App developer
- Museums and Museum Gift Shops

## Domains
Domains of knowledge that contain or intersect with my game idea:
- Card Games
- Collectables
- Displays
- Virtual inventory/ collectables
- Souvenirs 
- Art History
- Fine Art
- Museum Curation
- Art Mediums

## Precedents
Exisiting games and products that have similiar concepts as my game:
- Pokémon cards / go
- Baseball cards
- Penny flattening machines
- Wax o’ matic
- Neko Atsume
- Art postcards / small prints in the gift shop
- Animal Crossing Art Museum

## Key Concepts
Important concepts I hope to capture in my game:
### Core:
- Museum Exploration
- Art History and Context
- Art Collecting
### Peripheral:
- Talking about art with friends
- Knowing the most about art
- Having the best collection
- Curating a gallery
- Comparing and contrasting art

## Ethical Considerations
Parts of my game that could be legally or morally ambiguous:
- Legally representing art.
- Giving all art pieces their proper individual context and importance.
- Not providing people with certain backgrounds an upper edge.
- Making it accessible both physically and contextually.

## Assessment
How we can assess whether the intended transformations have been effective from using the game.
### Knowledge
Players will get better at winning trivia matches as time goes on.
### Behavioral
Museums with the program get more visitors from using the game.
### Relationships
Player in-game networks expand and inner relationships grow as they play the game.
