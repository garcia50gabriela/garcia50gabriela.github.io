## Summary and Reflection
Mid-way through the semester, I became inspired to make a game about being a mermaid.
Mermaids as a subject matter inspired me to pursue an interesting objective of crashing ships, I believe this objective created a feeling of mischief and fantasy.

## Opportunities for Improvement
- I didn't get a chance to add sound effects to this game which was something I was aiming for.
- At the very least I'd like to add transitional animations that could signal to the player when their mermaid takes damage from a ship or the sister mermaids switch locations. Although, full animations of ships crashing and mermaids swimming would be ideal.
- Expansion with different goals, detriments, and powers could also make the game more interesting. Specifically, I am thinking of splash or wave power ups, sea animal friends or enemies, and maybe sea storm events.

## Opportunities for Experimentation
- Right now I am into the idea of experimental controllers. I think it would be fun to prototype a game controller in the shape of a seashell or starfish.
- I also think there is room for femme empowered narrative such as a story similiar to *The Little Mermaid* but the mermaid chooses her life/voice/family over the prince in the end.
- Or I could implement an environmental narrative in the game by adding coastal litter or oil spill events that the mermaid has to avoid or clean up.
