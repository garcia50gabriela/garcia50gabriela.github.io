# Game Design Document

## Game Overview:
- Title: Stone Seize (working title)
- Platform: Computer/Web
- Genre: Side and Vertical Scrolling Platformer

## Overview: 
### Game Experience: 
The player will play as Medusa and must get to an end goal in order to win the game. 
Medusa will be approached by hunters which will serve as obstacles in her path. In order to get past the hunters she will have to turn them into stone, but this power comes with the consequence of flipping the game map/controls every time she does this. 
There will also be an ongoing puzzle made of stone pieces that builds as the game goes on. This puzzle component will be vital for progressing through the game. Some levels will contain paths that can be blocked my “stoned” attackers, while other levels will contain paths that will need attackers turned into stone to unblock/progress them (ie. using them to jump onto a higher platform), or some combination of the two. Path blocking and puzzling is also where I’m hoping to incorporate moving stairways.
### Number of Players: 1
### Game Concept: 
The concept of this game originates in the story that hunters would use reflections to look at and hunt Medusa as a tactic to avoid looking her in the eyes. This game would give her some of that power back but at the cost of mirroring the controls and giving her a disadvantage.
### Game Theme: 
This game will encorporate subtle feminist themes by simulating unwanted advances by random men and giving Medusa power over the situation by turning them to stone and using them for her advantage.
Visual theme will consist of stone items and textures, moving stair-ways, and ancient greek architecture. 
I’d also like to create the visual effect of layered paper art by using a 3D game engine to make a 2D game. Example of Paper Art Style below.

### Target Audience: 
Everyone, or possibly a more mature audience depending on the nature of the advances expressed in the game (I am not sure how I want to convey this yet).

## Gameplay: 
### Goal: 
- Reach the end by maintaining your health.
- Solve the puzzle that will guide you forward in the process.
### Rules: 
- Every successful encounter made by attackers will lower the player’s health. 
- When the player loses all of their health the will lose the game.
- You can counteract attacks by using stone powers but it will come at a cost of disorienting the game. Also Mindfulness of when using stone powers will be needed in order to progress through blocked paths.
- Puzzles will present themselves throughout the game in the form of blocked paths that can be overcome by using correctly placed “stoned” attackers.
### Mechanics: 
- Arrow keys will be used for basic movements around the map.
- ‘Wasd’ keys will be used for turning attacker into stone in that direction. 
- As an added complication, Medusa will be able to “stone” and “un-stone” attackers and will need to avoid this in ways that will be detrimental, while aiming to progress through the level.
### Pieces: 
- The game map
- The player (Medusa)
- The attackers
- Other pieces such as health items

## Event or Showcase:
- I will look for a feminist oriented blog or event that focuses on new/digital media to submit this to when it is ready.
- Any suggestions are welcome!

## References:
- I will reference some of our foundational theories of Play and Game readings when thinking about how I want to implement play into my game, such as Salen and Zimmerman’s ‘Rules of Play’. I will use their advice to balance “puzzle” and “play” in my game.
- I will use Ian Bogost’s insight on Rhetoric in Video Games to try and express the subtle feminist themes I am aiming for and hopefully tell a story.
- I will use Kocurek’s insight on women who are overlooked as a reminder that I am making this game to express similar feelings and events.
- Games with inverted controls/maps like Mario Maker’s “Night Mode” or in some levels of Cup Head.
