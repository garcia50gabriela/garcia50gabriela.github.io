# Reflection on my Past Work
As I think about ideas to pursue for my thesis, I'd like to reflect on some of the games I've made during my time in the DePaul MFA in Game Design Program. A lot of them are somewhat unfinished, which is something to keep in mind while I'm thinking of scope of my thesis game.

## Basic Witch
Make aesthetically pleasing coffee drinks for your spooky customers as a witch barista while preparing for a Halloween party at the shop.

## Dolly
Play as a ragdoll who can detach and reattach their limbs to help them solve puzzles and retrieve their missing felt heart at the end of the puzzle.

## Vote 1-2-3
Made for 'The Legue of Women Voters' with 2 other classmates, a point and click adventure to help you register, prepare, and ultimately cast your vote.

## Cove
Crash ships into surrounding rocks with your alluring mermaid aura, and then collect the bones and treasures left behind. Earn bonus points for crashing the ships into the rocks near your mermaid sisters so they can also enjoy in the wreckage.

## Sightseeing
Go on a leisurely walk as Medusa, use your stone powers to make enemies additional platforms, and use your mirror like invertion powers to find alternate routes.

Make the perfect batch of microwave popcorn by carefully spacing out the pop of each kernal in the given time.
