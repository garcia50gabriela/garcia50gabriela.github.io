# Reflection on my Past Work
As I think about ideas to pursue for my thesis, I'd like to reflect on some of the games I've made during my time in the DePaul MFA in Game Design Program. A lot of them are somewhat unfinished, which is something to keep in mind while I'm thinking of scope of my thesis game.

***

## [Basic Witch](https://gvbrlv.itch.io/basic-witch)
**Make aesthetically pleasing coffee drinks for your spooky customers as a witch barista while preparing for a Halloween party at the shop.**

What went well:
- The gradient on the coffee cup looked nice
- The theming worked well
- Using social media as a placeholder for character cameos

What didn't go well:
- Didn't get as much story / narrative in as I wanted
- No audio
- I wanted a large pool of horror themed customers to randomly pick from each game (right now it's a static three)

***

## Dolly (Unfinished)
**Play as a ragdoll who can detach and reattach their limbs to help them solve puzzles and retrieve their missing felt heart at the end of the puzzle.**

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/game11.PNG" height="200"/><img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/game12.png" height="200"/>

What went well:
- I like the concept
- I got the mechanic working for detaching and reattaching body parts working

What didn't go well:
- Never thought of a way to use the head in the puzzle
- Didn't get anything near a finished product

***

## [Vote 1-2-3](https://gvbrlv.itch.io/vote-1-2-3)
**Made for 'The Legue of Women Voters' with 2 other classmates, a point and click adventure to help you register, prepare, and ultimately cast your vote.**

What went well:
- The team worked well together
- We had a finished game at the end of class

What didn't go well:
- Most of the time was spent figuring out how to connect to the google sheets API becuase the client wanted a way to dynamically update candidates

***

## [Cove](https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/Cove/)
**Crash ships into surrounding rocks with your alluring mermaid aura, and then collect the bones and treasures left behind. Earn bonus points for crashing the ships into the rocks near your mermaid sisters so they can also enjoy in the wreckage.**

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/game4.PNG" height="400"/>
<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/game5.PNG" height="400"/>

What went well:
- The mechanic works well
- Looks good and kind of finished

What didn't go well:
- The layout of the scene causes the ships to take a long time to make it around the lighthouse / into the scene
- After a while, the game starts slowing down (I think this is because I don't delete treasure pieces after collecting them)

***

## [Sightseeing](https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/Medusa/)
**Go on a leisurely walk as Medusa, use your stone powers to make enemies additional platforms, and use your mirror like invertion powers to find alternate routes.**

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/game6.PNG" height="400"/>
<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/game7.PNG" height="400"/>

What went well:
- Working first level
- I like the concept and mechanic

What didn't go well:
- Didn't get the narrative that I wanted in
- Kind of buggy sometimes

***

## [Popcorn](https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/POPCORN/)
**Make the perfect batch of microwave popcorn by carefully spacing out the pop of each kernal in the given time.**

<img src="https://garcia50gabriela.github.io/images/game8.PNG" height="400"/>

What went well:
- Made it really quickly

What didn't go well:
- The timing mechanic could be more specific, it only divides the time left by the amount of popcorn left to ensure spaced out timing of each kernal
