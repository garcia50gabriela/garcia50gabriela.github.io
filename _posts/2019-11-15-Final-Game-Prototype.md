### Overall Thoughts
I am happy with my initial product and I think it has room to grow into a more complex game. I created a good foundation for interesting map designs. In the future I would like to make a map that feels more like a puzzle and explores the various combinations of vertical and horizontal space. The concept of Medusa going for a walk and dealing with unwanted approaches by men, is a simple, and relatable concept for a game. I think Iâ€™d like to explore ways in how I can make this theme more obvious in my game play and design.

I hope to continue polishing and finishing up this game so that I can submit it to indie game showcases in the near future.
