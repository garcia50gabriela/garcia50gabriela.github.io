# Users
When thinking about the game I want to create I want it to have 3 main features: engaging gameplay, a personal collection, and an educational aspect. I think these different main features will attract different kinds of users. Hopefully if the game is good enough some players will play it just because it's fun the community that builds around it. I think another type of person would be the type of person who just likes to collect things or personalize things, such as the type of person that likes to play sims or scrapbook. The third and possibly most important would be the parent or educator who wants to teach their kids about art, if the game design is good then I believe it could become a respected tool among trachers and parents. 

# Empathy Mappings
## 1. Gamer Type
First I thought about the gamer type. They are mostly concerned with what games everyone is playing and what games they enjoy playing themselves. Depending on the game, it could also be a focal point of some of their social groups. So I think this type of user would mostly be thinking about how to get better at games, socialize with games, and which games are worth spending type playing and getting good at.

## 2. Personalizer
Next, I thought about the collector type. I believe this user would enjoy the personalization and collection aspect of the game. They enjoy personalizing things and giving them personal meaning. They would enjoy building their own gallery and related it to events or museums they've been to. They might even attribute time spent with friends or loved ones to the pieces they collect and use them as a way to commemorate or remember special days like a museum visit with a family member.

## 3. Parent or Teacher
Since it's very possible that this game will be used with children since it's an educational tool, I think we should consider the person who allows them or promotes them to use the game.

## Elliot (the Educator)
The parent or gardian user will be my Educator persona. They may be a teacher, parent, or adult figure in a child's life, but their main concern with this game is using it as an educational tool for art.
