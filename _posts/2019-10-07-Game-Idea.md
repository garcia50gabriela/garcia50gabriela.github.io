# Initial Idea and Inspiration

Now that we're thinking about our final games/projects, I think I want to make a game with Medusa as the protagonist. I think using her as a game subject can set the grounds for a feminist inspired game.

I would like to make Medusa seem like a relatable character by using a narrative of Medusa minding her own business and unwillingly being approached by men/hunters. This should relate to a common female experience of not feeling safe or allowed to walk by themselves because of men. I also want the game to give power back to the player/ Medusa/ women by letting the player be able to circumvent the hunters by using medusa "stone-ing" powers.

I would also like to use the concept of mirroring as a game mechanic some how, since mirrors and reflection are a common theme in Medusa folklore.
