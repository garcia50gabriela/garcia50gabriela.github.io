## Game Design Document Feedback
I recieved some feedback on my game design document from classmates and my instructor.

One interesting point was how can I use the the mechanics of the game to create a feminsit narrative. It was suggested that I should use the power of being able to turn the hunters into stone to the players advantage as a way to promote the femenist themes.

I've also been talking to other classmates about what I want the "mirroring" mechanic to look and feel like. I'm still pretty unsure about this. People have been able to give a few examples of similair concepts being used, such as inverting visible and visable platforms when activated. But I really want this mechanic to look like a mirror effect so I don't think that is what I'm going for.
