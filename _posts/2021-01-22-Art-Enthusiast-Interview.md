# Interview: Vince W. (Art Enthusiast)
## Context
This was an impromptu interview with a friend of mine, Vince. We were casually talking about the art museum feature in 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons', when I realized Vince is probably the most knowledgable person I know when it comes to Fine Arts. His degrees are mostly in literature so I'm not sure how much that might intersect with this knowledge, but he is always taking trips to museums near and far, and talking about old art. Going to a museum with him is like getting a private tour.

## Questions
### Question 1: Why is the art museum your favorite part of Animal Crossing?
- Vince enjoyed feeling like he had his own art collection and space to appreciate them.
- He also enjoyed seeing and comparing other playersâ€™ collections and coordinating with other players to get more pieces.

### Question 2: What are your issues with this experience?
- Vince wished there was more flexibility and autonomy to the game so he could collect faster than what the game allowed.
- This has detered him from playing the game as much as he used to.

### Question 3: How would you make it better?
- He would like more ways to pursue art pieces and opportunities to do so around his schedule.
- He wished that the game has more opportunities for education and real life context and history. You can play this mechanic without learning much about the artual piece the item is meant to represent.
