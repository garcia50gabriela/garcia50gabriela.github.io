For my prototype I mostly focused on getting the inverse or mirror mechanic that I wanted for my game.

It was hard for me to decide what I wanted this to look like without playing with the code first. But I think I figured out something that I like.

Ny playing with the gravity, colldier boxes, and camera in Unity I was able to achieve a mirroring effect. When the player presses the down arrow, the platform becomes inverted and the player can walk on what was once the under side of the game.

This mechanic can be used to get on top of platforms that are too high to jump on like the white one below.

By inversing and falling down what was once the platform, and then inversing again the player will be on top of the platform.

I'm excited to try to build a game around this mechanic. This is what I was most worried about so moving forward I can focus on the game design and details.
