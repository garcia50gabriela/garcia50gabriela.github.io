# Interview: Kate B. (Actress)
## Context
I reached out to an old friend from grade school who I knew went to college in New York to pursue acting and theater. She has since moved back to Chicago and was involved with local/small theaters before the Covid Crisis. She hopes one day things will go back to normal but has not pursued alternatives at this time.







## Questions
### Question 1: Why do you enjoy participating in local theater?
- Kate enjoys the community and opportunity to do what she loves to do.
- She also likes that there are more opportunities to be involved on a higher level such as coordinating shows and being involved in the design of the final show.

### Question 2: What do you miss about theater school?
- Kate misses learning about plays or writings that she would usually not engage in.
- And also being part of a community that was learning / performing the same thing so she built more relationships with people through that bonding experience.

### Question 3: What originally drew you to pursue this career?
- She never saw herself as a performer but after being in a high school play she enjoyed the escape and ability to completely invest herself in this new experience and role.
- From there she wanted more training/opportunities for similar experiences.
