# Five Chair Challenge
An assignment done with Jess Reed to create interations of a chair using different materials.

## Character Card
This is the character card we had:

So Niel is the person we have to design a chair for, by keeping needs in mind from the provided description.

## Needs and Design Principles
### Needs:
- The chair will need to be bolted into something so that it remains stationary.
- A Partial swivel and shpere shapre could make it easy to turn and enter as needed.
- Stability helpers such as seatbelts0, strap, and handles.
- A wide seat so that it is easy to get in and out of, and can a person wearing a large space suit.

### Design Principle(s):
- Make it efficient and easy for sitting in space where there is no gravity.
- Able to sit comfortably and stably in a bulky suit, in the weightlessness of space.

## Chairs
So here are the chairs we came up with. They were all iterations of the same design but their materials revealed different things.

### Chair 1

- For the drawings we each took time to draw the first things we had in mind (left: left, right: top), and then showed each other to compare and contrast.
- Then the second time we each drew another itreration (left: right, right:bottom) with what we had learned from each other in mind.
- I think it's interesting to see the two ideas come together in the second set of drawings.

### Chair 2

- Since cardboard is a rigid material I spent most of my time trying to create the spherical shape
- Cardboard worked well for making the upper/lower attachment stands.
- The resulting prototype was pretty stable and could stand on its own.

### Chair 3

- Vibrant pipe cleaner colors make for a more aesthetically pleasing design.
- Malleability of pipe cleaners was ideal for the multi-part design of our chair. Pieces were individually constructed and nested into one another.
- Outer pod functions more like a standing hammock in this design :)
- The seat (green) is not as clearly conceivable as it could be. Maybe cutting pipe cleaners instead of folding would have been better.

### Chair 4

- Clay didnâ€™t allow for as much differentiation between the individual parts of the chair as other materials.
- Everything sort of melded into one unit, but different colors help to show the different parts. 
- Was able to make the seat itself look more clearly like a seat than in other iterations.
- The aesthetic quality of the clay design is lacking.

- Q-tips were pretty rigid as well, so I mostly focused on creating the spherical shape. 
- I found I could slightly bend them without breaking them to make vertices.
- Small and hard to tape together
- Made me realize the design could possibly work as octahedron shape as well.
