## Asssets
I spent some time working on the assets for my game today. I think I will be able to achieve the general aesthetic that I wanted for the prototype. I wanted a smooth style and more interesting backgrounds but for the sake of time I made everything with https://www.piskelapp.com/ .

### Backgrounds
These columns and pattern will be used for the background.

### Special Items
The vines will be used as an extra obstacle for the player. I needed something to control where the player is able to invert and not invert, so they can't beat the game completely in one mode. I knew I wanted vines in my game, and originally thought I'd use spikes as the obstacle. But using them together made sense stylistically. I based the design of the toxic Aconite flower, which was often used in greek mythology as poison.

This doorway will be used as the exit and entrance.
