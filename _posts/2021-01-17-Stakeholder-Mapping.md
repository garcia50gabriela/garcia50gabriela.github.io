# Stakeholder Mapping
I am planning to make a physical game that will engage people in either theater or arts. The games will be aimed at people or families who enjoy playing games together and depending on the final outcome could be useful to educators. Possible stakeholders could be from theater, art, gaming, or educational communities. Here is an attempt to make some stakeholders based on their influence on the idea and impact.
