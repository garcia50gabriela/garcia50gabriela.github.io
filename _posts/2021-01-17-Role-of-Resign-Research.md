# Role of Design Research

Design Research is research that is done with the intention of influencing a design to serve the needs of the people it was created for. It differs from Pure Research which aims to uncover existing but unknown facts, such as Scientific Research. It is not personal research because it does not get it’s information from second hand sources. And it doesn’t seem to be quite like Market Research either which aims to find out more about a target market.

Design Research it helpful because it will help you make informed decisions. It can validate or refute assumptions, supplement knowledge, unveil the unknown, or help you understand your constraints. It is a process for gaining the hard to know knowledge before finding out the hard way, such as by implementing something that will fail. This makes it a very efficient strategy, since if done well, the time resources invested into it will be saved by the efficiency of the development later.

The context of the chapter seemed very business/product related, which we all may very well find ourselves doing research in this context one day (ie. designing game feature expansions for a studio). I think myself and my peers often design the games we want to see, but one day we might have to switch to a business point of view. But in the mean time I think it gives us a good approach and way to think about the design decisions we make and why we make them. It may even be useful to prep some design research questions for yourself to help clarify a game you want to make.
