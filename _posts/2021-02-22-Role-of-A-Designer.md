# Ruined by Design: what is the role/responsibility of a designer?
According to Monteiro, we work for all of the normal people affected by our design, even, or especially so, the marginalized folks of whatever design problem we are facing. I agree with a lot of what he says, although it is very idealistic I think it is important to keep in mind as much as possible.

As an engineer, I am not a fan of the “work fast and break things” mentality, mostly because I am the meticulous type of engineer who ends up having to clean up and fix things that the original system was never meant to support. I also agree with all of the criticism that he has towards tech companies.

But I think the unfortunate reality of the situation is that under capitalism, there is no motivation to do anything that doesn’t make money. I blame a lot of problems on capitalism, but it’s a system that has made it “inefficient” or “unaffordable” to be a good person, and that can’t be good.

I hope that one day, I have the power as a designer to make some of these decisions that Monterio is pushing for. But I also worry that the world is just not changing fast enough. We have seen some changes and awareness to these problems recently but I don’t think any real progress will be made until there is a large systematic change.

I know there is a lot of dark design happening in games, but at least the pursuit of entertainment is a generally noble one. Which is one reason I think I am drawn to game design. The world kind of sucks, but maybe I can help someone escape and be entertained for a little while.

A lot of the design decisions he gives as examples, are large scale ones, so I think as a prospective designer it’s hard to imagine myself being able to do anything in these example scenarios. But keeping these examples in mind, hopefully we will be able to do the right thing and make good design decisions here and there, when given the influence to do so, even if it’s for a larger more corrupt system. The little things add up right?
